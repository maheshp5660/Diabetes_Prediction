# Diabetes_Prediction

Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

Diabetes is a medical disorder that impacts how well our body uses food as fuel. Most food we eat daily is converted to sugar, commonly known as glucose, and then discharged into the bloodstream. Our pancreas releases insulin when the blood sugar levels rise.

Diabetes can cause blood sugar levels to rise if it is not continuously and carefully managed, which raises the chance of severe side effects like heart attack and stroke.
 we will be predicting that whether the patient has diabetes or not on the basis of the features we will provide to our machine learning model.
 
 
 
 
Installing the Libraries


Importing the Dataset

Data analysis: Here one will get to know about how the data analysis part is done in a data science life cycle.
Exploratory data analysis: EDA is one of the most important steps in the data science project life cycle and here one will need to know that how to make inferences from the visualizations and data analysis.

Feature Engineering.

Model building: Here we will be using 4 ML models and then we will choose the best performing model.

Prediction Model:

Saving model: Saving the best model using pickle to make the prediction from real data.


“Streamlit is a faster way to build and share data apps”.

Streamlit is an open-source Python library and app framework which helps to create a custom frontend for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.

We will create a simple web application for a loan default prediction ML model which will help users to predict whether the loan applicant is able to pay the loan back or not given user inputs.






pip install streamlit


streamlit hello
 this line is use the Command Line type the line and then enter .
streamlit run myfile.py
